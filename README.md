# Shop101

This is a fully functional e-commerce website with a well detailed and simple UI  built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I tried as much to model a real ecommerce website, with most functionality included from filtering products functionalities etc to checkout with Stripe.

**Live demo is [here](https://shop101.vercel.app/).**

**Note: For the checkout page, you can test with a fake credit card number e.g for stripe default test card number 424242424242424, the rest field can be random**


### Continued development

I might consider adding user authentication and an admin panel to manage products.



```js
export const JustAnotherProject = () => {
  return <>ðŸŽ‰</>;
};
```
